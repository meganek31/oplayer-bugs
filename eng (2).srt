1
00:00:00,078 --> 00:00:02,984
- Previously on Lucifer...
- Still no sign of Lucifer?

2
00:00:02,986 --> 00:00:04,820
I went by his place. He's gone.

3
00:00:04,822 --> 00:00:05,822
Lucifer, who is this?

4
00:00:05,824 --> 00:00:08,263
Meet Candy Morningstar, my wife.

5
00:00:08,265 --> 00:00:10,778
The issue? That would
be Lucifer disappearing

6
00:00:10,781 --> 00:00:13,653
and then popping back
up with zero explanation

7
00:00:13,656 --> 00:00:15,125
and a ditzy bimbo on his arm.

8
00:00:15,128 --> 00:00:16,755
I thought that she
meant something to you.

9
00:00:16,757 --> 00:00:18,398
I had to save her from...

10
00:00:18,401 --> 00:00:20,661
From you. You're not ignoring
Chloe, you're protecting her.

11
00:00:20,663 --> 00:00:23,000
Are you going to Paris?
Can I be your travel buddy?

12
00:00:23,003 --> 00:00:24,516
I love Paris.

13
00:00:24,519 --> 00:00:27,920
This is the Paris Hotel in Vegas.

14
00:00:27,923 --> 00:00:29,857
Not going there.

15
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:31,594
Vegas and me... not pretty.

16
00:00:31,597 --> 00:00:34,750
And I have held the
real truth back from you.

17
00:00:34,753 --> 00:00:35,785
Why is it not working?

18
00:00:35,788 --> 00:00:37,244
You know, I keep caring,

19
00:00:37,246 --> 00:00:39,172
and you just... just...

20
00:00:39,175 --> 00:00:40,958
No, Detective, I...

21
00:00:43,368 --> 00:00:47,125
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

22
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:52,059
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

23
00:00:52,061 --> 00:00:57,564
♪ Happy birthday, dear Chloe ♪

24
00:00:57,566 --> 00:01:01,699
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

25
00:01:01,702 --> 00:01:02,802
To you.

26
00:01:02,805 --> 00:01:05,673
Oh, thanks.

27
00:01:14,717 --> 00:01:16,216
No.

28
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:22,391
No. No.

29
00:01:22,394 --> 00:01:23,394
Yes!

30
00:01:28,297 --> 00:01:30,797
Finally, an X-rated office party.

31
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,867
Leave it to you to
steal my thunder, huh?

32
00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:36,503
Well, much as I'd love to
take credit for this, Daniel,

33
00:01:36,505 --> 00:01:38,711
Officer Snake Hips is not my doing.

34
00:01:38,714 --> 00:01:40,240
Hmm, right.

35
00:01:40,242 --> 00:01:41,442
Make it rain,

36
00:01:41,444 --> 00:01:42,443
birthday girl.

37
00:01:42,445 --> 00:01:44,511
- Was this you?
- Yep.

38
00:01:44,513 --> 00:01:45,579
I did not see that coming.

39
00:01:45,581 --> 00:01:47,953
Hey, what can I say?

40
00:01:47,956 --> 00:01:50,390
Big surprise, little package.

41
00:01:50,393 --> 00:01:52,386
Big package, by the looks of it.

42
00:01:52,388 --> 00:01:54,321
Slap it.

43
00:01:54,323 --> 00:01:55,723
Slap it!

44
00:01:55,725 --> 00:01:57,091
Oh. I'm sorry.

45
00:01:58,894 --> 00:02:00,227
Lucifer Morningstar.

46
00:02:02,965 --> 00:02:05,235
Las Vegas Police Department?

47
00:02:07,203 --> 00:02:09,572
Candy? No, I-I'm gonna stop you there.

48
00:02:09,574 --> 00:02:11,422
She's my ex-wife, actually.

49
00:02:11,425 --> 00:02:13,525
Can you believe it takes
a year to annul something

50
00:02:13,528 --> 00:02:15,194
that only lasted a couple of weeks?

51
00:02:16,414 --> 00:02:18,781
No, I haven't spoken
to her for a few months.

52
00:02:18,783 --> 00:02:20,115
Why do you ask?

53
00:02:21,953 --> 00:02:24,313
What? She's missing?

54
00:02:26,724 --> 00:02:28,457
Uh, yes, yes, of course.

55
00:02:28,459 --> 00:02:31,227
I-I'm in Los Angeles, but
if you do hear anything,

56
00:02:31,229 --> 00:02:32,661
please contact me.

57
00:02:35,633 --> 00:02:38,267
Aw, don't worry, buddy, look,
I got more singles for you.

58
00:02:38,269 --> 00:02:41,103
Oh, no, no, no, I'm all
right for cash, thank you.

59
00:02:41,105 --> 00:02:43,372
You okay?

60
00:02:43,374 --> 00:02:46,709
That was the Las Vegas
Police Department.

61
00:02:46,711 --> 00:02:48,919
It appears my ex, Candy, is missing.

62
00:02:48,922 --> 00:02:51,347
Oh, my gosh, I hope she's okay, buddy.

63
00:02:51,349 --> 00:02:52,681
Yes, as do I.

64
00:02:52,683 --> 00:02:55,484
Candy was caught up in
some rather nasty business,

65
00:02:55,486 --> 00:02:56,952
but I thought I'd taken care of it.

66
00:02:56,954 --> 00:02:58,521
- Nasty business?
- Yes.

67
00:02:58,524 --> 00:03:01,661
In exchange, she helped
me with a delicate matter.

68
00:03:01,664 --> 00:03:04,021
I hate to think I haven't
fulfilled my end of the bargain.

69
00:03:04,024 --> 00:03:06,895
All right, I'll kill the
music. We'll all help find her.

70
00:03:06,897 --> 00:03:08,631
Oh, no, no, no, no, um...

71
00:03:08,633 --> 00:03:11,100
I don't want to spoil the
detective's celebrations.

72
00:03:11,102 --> 00:03:13,571
No, I'll just beetle on over to Sin City

73
00:03:13,574 --> 00:03:14,974
and check on Candy myself.

74
00:03:14,977 --> 00:03:20,224
Oh, yeah, you know, I kind
of have a thing with Vegas.

75
00:03:20,227 --> 00:03:23,422
Otherwise, I would totally,
totally offer to go with you.

76
00:03:23,425 --> 00:03:25,314
Right. Good to know.

77
00:03:25,316 --> 00:03:27,916
But then, I can tell that
it's really important to you,

78
00:03:27,918 --> 00:03:30,896
and I do have the next
couple of days off, so...

79
00:03:30,899 --> 00:03:33,289
okay, you've convinced me.

80
00:03:33,291 --> 00:03:34,423
I will help you.

81
00:03:34,425 --> 00:03:36,458
- What? I...
- Help him? Help him with what?

82
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:38,861
Please don't tell me you
guys got another stripper.

83
00:03:38,863 --> 00:03:40,530
- No, he got a...
- Uh, no, no, no, no, no.

84
00:03:40,532 --> 00:03:43,000
Nothing for the birthday
girl to worry about.

85
00:03:43,003 --> 00:03:45,297
I want you to focus on
one thing only, Detective.

86
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,985
That is getting older.

87
00:03:46,988 --> 00:03:48,837
Excuse me?

88
00:03:48,839 --> 00:03:50,005
Wait, you're leaving?

89
00:03:50,007 --> 00:03:51,173
Yeah, I'll call you later.

90
00:03:51,175 --> 00:03:52,408
Wait.

91
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:53,433
Seriously, Detective,

92
00:03:53,436 --> 00:03:56,037
you just stay here.

93
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,913
It's my birthday.

94
00:03:57,915 --> 00:03:59,481
Shake your booty while you still can.

95
00:03:59,483 --> 00:04:01,583
Oh, there you go.

96
00:04:09,393 --> 00:04:11,827
Mmm, you smell that?

97
00:04:11,829 --> 00:04:14,730
That is pleather, cigars,

98
00:04:14,732 --> 00:04:16,432
and vomit, my friend.

99
00:04:16,434 --> 00:04:18,701
I have to say, I didn't
have a good Catholic girl

100
00:04:18,703 --> 00:04:21,070
like yourself pegged
as a fan of Sin City.

101
00:04:21,072 --> 00:04:22,538
Mm, not a fan, exactly.

102
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:25,240
More like a tiny, helpless space capsule

103
00:04:25,242 --> 00:04:27,876
being sucked into a deadly black hole.

104
00:04:29,613 --> 00:04:30,813
Anyway, shall we?

105
00:04:30,815 --> 00:04:32,147
Uh...

106
00:04:33,705 --> 00:04:34,938
Chloe again?

107
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:37,820
You know what they say,
fifth time's the charm.

108
00:04:37,822 --> 00:04:40,422
Lucifer, you should really
tell her what's going on.

109
00:04:40,424 --> 00:04:42,324
It's still her birthday.

110
00:04:42,326 --> 00:04:44,259
And you're still going with that.

111
00:04:44,261 --> 00:04:45,558
Okay.

112
00:04:45,561 --> 00:04:47,511
Officer.

113
00:04:54,138 --> 00:04:56,605
Either it's someone else's birthday...

114
00:04:56,607 --> 00:04:59,408
Or this is an active crime scene.

115
00:05:00,745 --> 00:05:03,512
Oh, no.

116
00:05:03,514 --> 00:05:04,747
Candy?

117
00:05:04,749 --> 00:05:06,515
Oh, Lucifer,

118
00:05:06,517 --> 00:05:08,484
I'm so sorry, buddy.

119
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,487
Man, her face is gone.

120
00:05:11,489 --> 00:05:13,255
Hello.

121
00:05:13,257 --> 00:05:14,723
Look at those dainty feet.

122
00:05:18,089 --> 00:05:21,399
Okay, not judging here, but really?

123
00:05:21,402 --> 00:05:23,492
Is this really the time
for the pervy stuff?

124
00:05:23,495 --> 00:05:24,617
Dainty feet?

125
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:27,136
Um, debatable, but that's
not what I was talking about.

126
00:05:27,138 --> 00:05:29,671
No, Candy has ginormous feet.

127
00:05:29,673 --> 00:05:30,839
I mean, regular boats,

128
00:05:30,841 --> 00:05:32,241
huge.

129
00:05:32,243 --> 00:05:34,438
That means that this is not Candy.

130
00:05:34,441 --> 00:05:37,112
Oh, man, that's awesome!

131
00:05:37,114 --> 00:05:38,680
Shh.

132
00:05:38,682 --> 00:05:41,797
Sorry, my-my friend here.

133
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,786
Not a fan of the deceased, I'm afraid.

134
00:05:43,788 --> 00:05:44,683
Mean,

135
00:05:44,686 --> 00:05:47,289
she was just so mean.

136
00:05:47,292 --> 00:05:49,268
- Ah, you...
- Shh. Women.

137
00:05:49,271 --> 00:05:55,221
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -

138
00:05:56,634 --> 00:05:58,476
- We should go.
- Mm-hmm.

139
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,210
Excuse me, I'm Detective
Long, and you are?

140
00:06:01,212 --> 00:06:04,480
Um, Lucifer Morningstar. Pleasure.

141
00:06:04,482 --> 00:06:06,048
You're Candy's husband.

142
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:07,383
Ex-husband.

143
00:06:07,385 --> 00:06:09,685
Right. I talked to you on the phone.

144
00:06:09,687 --> 00:06:11,220
You said you were in Los Angeles.

145
00:06:11,222 --> 00:06:12,265
Oh, yes.

146
00:06:12,268 --> 00:06:14,323
And you don't seem very broken up

147
00:06:14,325 --> 00:06:16,058
about your ex-wife's death.

148
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:18,361
Well, that's because
this woman is not my wife.

149
00:06:18,363 --> 00:06:21,369
Right, 'cause she's your ex-wife.

150
00:06:21,372 --> 00:06:23,639
Think you made that pretty clear, buddy.

151
00:06:24,168 --> 00:06:26,035
Hi, how you doing?

152
00:06:26,037 --> 00:06:28,544
Ella Lopez, LAPD CSI.

153
00:06:28,547 --> 00:06:31,474
For the record, we just got into town.

154
00:06:31,476 --> 00:06:32,976
Arrived at 1300 hours

155
00:06:32,979 --> 00:06:34,577
and 14 minutes, to be exact.

156
00:06:34,579 --> 00:06:37,380
And, based on a visual assessment

157
00:06:37,382 --> 00:06:39,315
of the victim's lividity,

158
00:06:39,317 --> 00:06:43,052
she's been deceased for, oh, I'd say

159
00:06:43,054 --> 00:06:45,716
2100 hours yesterday.

160
00:06:45,719 --> 00:06:48,958
So, my travel buddy here, not a suspect.

161
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,476
- Uh...
- Uh-huh.

162
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:53,396
Also, I know, none of my beeswax, but...

163
00:06:53,398 --> 00:06:55,398
I saw that you were going
with an ultraviolet light

164
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,432
on the couch.

165
00:06:56,434 --> 00:06:57,833
I would have gone with
a straight oblique,

166
00:06:57,835 --> 00:06:58,934
man, but you know what,

167
00:06:58,936 --> 00:07:00,369
to each his own.

168
00:07:00,371 --> 00:07:01,934
Okay, thanks for the advice.

169
00:07:01,937 --> 00:07:03,470
You got it, Detective.

170
00:07:04,675 --> 00:07:07,539
Ixnay on the ot-nay andy-cay.

171
00:07:07,542 --> 00:07:08,909
Sorry, is that German? 'Cause if it is,

172
00:07:08,911 --> 00:07:10,079
it's absolutely awful.

173
00:07:10,081 --> 00:07:11,947
Trust me, I should know.
Hitler was a talker.

174
00:07:11,949 --> 00:07:13,286
Well, screamer, actually.

175
00:07:13,289 --> 00:07:16,231
No, I'm saying that for now,

176
00:07:16,234 --> 00:07:19,075
we shouldn't let LVPD
know that that's not Candy.

177
00:07:19,078 --> 00:07:20,823
If this gets back to the killer,

178
00:07:20,825 --> 00:07:22,601
he might try to kill her again.

179
00:07:22,604 --> 00:07:25,461
Oh, right, yes. Good idea, Ms. Lopez.

180
00:07:25,463 --> 00:07:27,898
- Good idea.
- What's a good idea?

181
00:07:27,901 --> 00:07:29,133
- Um...
- Um...

182
00:07:30,698 --> 00:07:32,364
To give you my card.

183
00:07:32,367 --> 00:07:33,317
Her card.

184
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,270
In case you want any more advice.

185
00:07:36,273 --> 00:07:37,673
Always happy to help.

186
00:07:37,675 --> 00:07:39,475
- She's very good.
- Very.

187
00:07:39,477 --> 00:07:42,178
Right. I have a feeling
I will be talking

188
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,680
to both of you again before
the investigation's over.

189
00:07:44,682 --> 00:07:45,781
I doubt that.

190
00:07:45,783 --> 00:07:47,550
I mean, hanging out
with a cop in Las Vegas

191
00:07:47,553 --> 00:07:49,787
is like bringing your
grandma to an orgy.

192
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:51,255
Am I right?

193
00:07:51,258 --> 00:07:52,640
No.

194
00:07:52,643 --> 00:07:54,122
Okay, bye.

195
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:55,691
Bye.

196
00:08:01,766 --> 00:08:03,032
Hi.

197
00:08:03,034 --> 00:08:05,355
Is, uh... Hi, sorry to interrupt.

198
00:08:05,358 --> 00:08:06,724
Have you heard from Lucifer?

199
00:08:06,727 --> 00:08:08,723
No, why? Has something happened?

200
00:08:08,726 --> 00:08:10,639
No, not really. I just, I, uh...

201
00:08:10,641 --> 00:08:12,041
I had a question about a case,

202
00:08:12,043 --> 00:08:14,618
and, um, I can't... I
can't get ahold of him.

203
00:08:14,621 --> 00:08:15,887
Yeah, we were...

204
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:18,113
we were, uh, celebrating
my birthday at the precinct,

205
00:08:18,115 --> 00:08:19,748
and, um, and then, all of a sudden,

206
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:22,451
he just bailed, and now he's
not answering my calls, so...

207
00:08:23,688 --> 00:08:25,588
Would you like to have a seat?

208
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:27,903
No, no, it's not a big deal.

209
00:08:27,906 --> 00:08:29,091
You sure?

210
00:08:29,093 --> 00:08:31,527
Mm-hmm. Yeah, I'm fine.

211
00:08:31,529 --> 00:08:32,628
I'm fine.

212
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:34,530
It's probably just
Lucifer being Lucifer.

213
00:08:34,532 --> 00:08:36,398
You know? Probably.

214
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:39,351
Yeah.

215
00:08:39,354 --> 00:08:42,905
Please, have a seat.

216
00:08:42,907 --> 00:08:44,874
I don't really, you know...

217
00:08:44,876 --> 00:08:47,243
I know you're busy,
and I don't want to...

218
00:08:47,245 --> 00:08:50,216
take up... I-I checked
Lux, and he wasn't there.

219
00:08:50,219 --> 00:08:52,489
And-and I thought I'd go up
to the penthouse to check,

220
00:08:52,492 --> 00:08:53,669
but last time he went AWOL,

221
00:08:53,672 --> 00:08:55,384
I went up there to check on him,

222
00:08:55,386 --> 00:08:57,484
and all of his furniture
was covered in sheets,

223
00:08:57,487 --> 00:08:59,020
and he had run off to Vegas.

224
00:08:59,023 --> 00:09:00,786
Of course, that's when we...

225
00:09:00,789 --> 00:09:03,425
we were getting together,
which we totally are not

226
00:09:03,427 --> 00:09:04,894
anymore, nor will we.

227
00:09:04,896 --> 00:09:06,859
But, you know, it's my birthday.

228
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,232
Mm-hmm.

229
00:09:10,234 --> 00:09:12,434
Wow, good couch.

230
00:09:12,436 --> 00:09:13,602
I know.

231
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:17,205
And I understand.

232
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:19,408
Birthdays can be emotional.

233
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:20,734
I guess.

234
00:09:20,737 --> 00:09:22,211
No, I'm good, I'm good.

235
00:09:22,213 --> 00:09:24,513
He's, um... he's probably
just in the penthouse

236
00:09:24,515 --> 00:09:25,981
passed out or something.

237
00:09:27,023 --> 00:09:28,417
Emphasis on "something."

238
00:09:28,419 --> 00:09:31,053
How about I go with you?

239
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:36,158
Please.

240
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,727
Seems Candy dodged a
bullet, quite literally.

241
00:09:38,729 --> 00:09:40,528
Or a shotgun blast, anyway.

242
00:09:40,531 --> 00:09:42,895
Yes, so, we need to find this killer

243
00:09:42,898 --> 00:09:45,367
before he or she realizes their mistake.

244
00:09:45,369 --> 00:09:47,503
Detective Nosy in
there could get DNA back

245
00:09:47,505 --> 00:09:49,255
on that body within 24 hours.

246
00:09:49,258 --> 00:09:50,239
Yeah.

247
00:09:50,241 --> 00:09:52,591
So, we got to find a lead, stat.

248
00:09:52,594 --> 00:09:54,488
- Right.
- Okay, so you were married to Candy

249
00:09:54,491 --> 00:09:56,591
- for a week...
- Uh, two weeks.

250
00:09:56,594 --> 00:09:59,648
Mm-hmm. I mean, any idea
who would want her dead?

251
00:10:06,657 --> 00:10:10,092

Psychic bartender. My favorite.

260
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:33,682
Who is she?

261
00:10:33,684 --> 00:10:35,884
Not the one singing, the
reason you're drinking.

262
00:10:35,886 --> 00:10:38,520

00:11:08,786 --> 00:11:11,954
That was Candy.

279
00:11:11,956 --> 00:11:13,489
Aye.

280
00:11:13,491 --> 00:11:16,191
Think I'd quite like to
continue my chat with Candy.

281
00:11:17,461 --> 00:11:19,495
Uh...

282
00:11:19,497 --> 00:11:21,063
Where's my money?

283
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:24,974
And my ring.

284
00:11:27,562 --> 00:11:30,773
Bravo, Candy.

285
00:11:30,775 --> 00:11:32,828
Emergencies.

286
00:11:34,612 --> 00:11:36,011
Ow, you're hurting me.

287
00:11:36,013 --> 00:11:37,778
Just-just give me
some more time, please.

288
00:11:37,781 --> 00:11:39,682
I'll have it for you.

289
00:11:42,987 --> 00:11:44,820
His name's Louie Pagliani.

290
00:11:44,822 --> 00:11:47,742
He's a local loan shark
and all-around dirtbag.

291
00:11:47,745 --> 00:11:49,458
I thought I dealt with that human stain

292
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:50,559
last time I was here.

293
00:11:50,561 --> 00:11:53,286
Yeah, well... this is Vegas.

294
00:11:53,289 --> 00:11:55,710
This town is always up for an encore.

295
00:12:04,608 --> 00:12:06,775
Ah, there you go.

296
00:12:06,777 --> 00:12:09,011
They teach lock picking
in forensic class?

297
00:12:09,013 --> 00:12:10,895
No. Middle school.

298
00:12:11,916 --> 00:12:14,483
Ms. Lopez, you are an
enigma, wrapped in a hoodie

299
00:12:14,485 --> 00:12:16,118
under a jaunty ponytail.

300
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,454
It...

301
00:12:18,456 --> 00:12:21,290
Oh, no.

302
00:12:21,292 --> 00:12:22,791
The annihilation.

303
00:12:22,793 --> 00:12:24,793
Ugh.

304
00:12:24,795 --> 00:12:27,162
Even if Louie didn't kill fake Candy,

305
00:12:27,164 --> 00:12:29,798
this decor alone is enough
for immediate execution.

306
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,066
I mean...

307
00:12:31,068 --> 00:12:33,106
What was he thinking?

308
00:12:33,109 --> 00:12:36,839
Well, uh, looks like someone
beat you to the execution part.

309
00:12:42,474 --> 00:12:43,906
Louie?

310
00:12:43,909 --> 00:12:45,669
Oh, definitely.

311
00:12:45,672 --> 00:12:47,750
I'd know those hairy ham hands anywhere.

312
00:12:51,028 --> 00:12:52,877
The trajectory of the blood spatter

313
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,486
in relation to the
stiff makes zero sense.

314
00:12:55,489 --> 00:12:57,299
There's no way Louie pulled the trigger.

315
00:12:57,302 --> 00:12:59,816
Typical Vegas. Even
the suicides are fake.

316
00:12:59,818 --> 00:13:01,852
Yeah, and so is the hair color.

317
00:13:01,854 --> 00:13:03,546
Look at this.

318
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:05,956
- It's pink.
- Candy.

319
00:13:06,984 --> 00:13:08,687
Well, she was here.

320
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:10,994
You think Candy would've killed Louie,

321
00:13:10,996 --> 00:13:13,197
and then faked her
own death to disappear?

322
00:13:13,199 --> 00:13:16,567
Oh, no, no, no, no, no,
Candy's not a killer.

323
00:13:16,569 --> 00:13:18,602
No, just a thieving con woman.

324
00:13:18,604 --> 00:13:21,233
- You knew her one week.
- Two weeks.

325
00:13:21,236 --> 00:13:23,507
Well, you don't know
what she's capable of.

326
00:13:23,509 --> 00:13:24,608
Well...

327
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:27,377
Candy did owe Louie
money once upon a time,

328
00:13:27,379 --> 00:13:28,612
but I paid him off.

329
00:13:28,614 --> 00:13:30,113
Perhaps he wanted more.

330
00:13:31,016 --> 00:13:32,562
Huh.

331
00:13:32,565 --> 00:13:35,619
This must be Mrs. Ham Hands.

332
00:13:35,621 --> 00:13:37,523
Oh, dearie me.

333
00:13:37,526 --> 00:13:39,990
Someone's sending a painful message.

334
00:13:41,627 --> 00:13:44,494
If Louie was after Candy's candy...

335
00:13:44,496 --> 00:13:46,863
Maybe his old lady found out,

336
00:13:46,865 --> 00:13:50,276
followed who she thought
was Candy home from the club,

337
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:52,936
shot her, and then
framed/finished off Louie.

338
00:13:52,938 --> 00:13:55,205
Then we need to find
this murderous ginger

339
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:57,507
before she finds the real Candy.

340
00:13:57,509 --> 00:13:59,409
Ah, Roxie Pagliani.

341
00:13:59,411 --> 00:14:01,643
I suppose she's the missus.
Just block the caller I.D.

342
00:14:01,646 --> 00:14:03,580
You can't just call her.
What are you gonna say?

343
00:14:03,582 --> 00:14:05,905
Well, I'm gonna ask her if
she's the killer, of course.

344
00:14:05,908 --> 00:14:07,658
No. Terrible plan!

345
00:14:07,665 --> 00:14:09,186
- Give me that!
- What are you doing?

346
00:14:09,188 --> 00:14:10,220
Hello?

347
00:14:10,223 --> 00:14:11,814
Hi, yeah.

348
00:14:11,817 --> 00:14:15,176
This is Marcia calling
from Sensational Statues.

349
00:14:15,179 --> 00:14:16,087
Who?

350
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:17,556
"Sensational Statues"?

351
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:19,393
Yeah, yeah, we got that new, um...

352
00:14:19,396 --> 00:14:20,762
you know, that new...

353
00:14:20,765 --> 00:14:23,065
Oh, bust of Caesar you ordered.

354
00:14:23,068 --> 00:14:25,035
Uh-huh, it came out real sexy.

355
00:14:25,037 --> 00:14:26,986
- "Sexy"?
- Yeah, 30% off

356
00:14:26,989 --> 00:14:30,493
if we can drop it
wherever you are right now.

357
00:14:30,496 --> 00:14:32,424
I'm sorry, I didn't buy any bust.

358
00:14:32,427 --> 00:14:33,658
Pfft. You sure? Because I...

359
00:14:33,661 --> 00:14:35,112
Bada bing! Bada bing! Bada bing!

360
00:14:35,114 --> 00:14:37,280
Oh, whoopsie, whoopsie, my
mistake, doll, my mistake.

361
00:14:37,283 --> 00:14:38,448
See?

362
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:40,584
The truth would've been
much more expedient.

363
00:14:40,586 --> 00:14:43,595
Nope. I know exactly where Roxie is.

364
00:14:43,598 --> 00:14:44,921
I heard the sound

365
00:14:44,923 --> 00:14:46,823
of The Guido's Rainbow slot machine

366
00:14:46,825 --> 00:14:48,358
in the background of the call.

367
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,893
It's a vintage machine.

368
00:14:49,895 --> 00:14:53,330
And only one casino in Vegas has it:

369
00:14:53,332 --> 00:14:54,756
The Moonbeam.

370
00:14:54,759 --> 00:14:58,056
Well, ka-ching, Ms. Lopez.

371
00:14:59,351 --> 00:15:01,084
Well, no sheets on the furniture,

372
00:15:01,087 --> 00:15:02,820
that's a good sign.

373
00:15:02,823 --> 00:15:03,955
And...

374
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:06,159
it looks like...

375
00:15:06,162 --> 00:15:07,825
yep, the overnight bag is missing,

376
00:15:07,828 --> 00:15:09,594
so maybe he did go out of town.

377
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:11,748
On my birthday.

378
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,650
You know what, speaking
of, this is stupid.

379
00:15:13,652 --> 00:15:15,485
What are we doing here?
We should be celebrating.

380
00:15:15,487 --> 00:15:18,118
Yes! We should be celebrating.

381
00:15:18,121 --> 00:15:20,290
Yeah. So, where to?

382
00:15:20,292 --> 00:15:21,658
Hmm.

383
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:25,595
Actually, I do know this place
with an awesome sound system

384
00:15:25,597 --> 00:15:28,065
and all the top shelf you can drink.

385
00:15:28,067 --> 00:15:31,168
Best views in the city?

386
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:33,437
Seems a shame to let
that sunset go to waste.

387
00:15:51,767 --> 00:15:53,290
Hamlet!

388
00:15:53,292 --> 00:15:54,451
Ah.

389
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:55,962
Hamlet.

390
00:15:57,663 --> 00:16:00,464
"Thanks for the punch up. Love, Will."

391
00:16:00,466 --> 00:16:01,998
Wow.

392
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,967
What you looking at?

393
00:16:03,969 --> 00:16:05,635
Nothing exciting.

394
00:16:05,637 --> 00:16:08,571
I'm Lucifer Morningstar.

395
00:16:08,574 --> 00:16:12,197
I can play the piano and
I'm a fancy British man.

396
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:15,544
Let's go take a peek in his sock drawer.

397
00:16:15,547 --> 00:16:18,014
But, Dr. Martin, you're his therapist.

398
00:16:18,016 --> 00:16:19,316
Aren't there rules against that?

399
00:16:19,318 --> 00:16:21,184
Trust me, there's nothing I don't know

400
00:16:21,186 --> 00:16:22,552
about Lucifer Morningstar.

401
00:16:22,554 --> 00:16:25,055
Except what's in his sock drawer.

402
00:16:25,057 --> 00:16:26,790
It's not like he can see us.

403
00:16:26,792 --> 00:16:28,392
Let's do it.

404
00:16:28,395 --> 00:16:29,594
Oh! Oh.

405
00:16:30,599 --> 00:16:31,885
Oh, oh, oh!

406
00:16:31,888 --> 00:16:33,263
- That's Lucifer, that's Lucifer.
- Oh. Oh.

407
00:16:33,265 --> 00:16:34,420
- Yeah, I can see that.
- That's Lucifer.

408
00:16:34,422 --> 00:16:36,161
Officially, officially creeped out!

409
00:16:36,164 --> 00:16:37,296
Okay, don't answer it.

410
00:16:37,299 --> 00:16:38,780
No, no, no, wait.
Answer it, answer it, uh,

411
00:16:38,782 --> 00:16:40,569
- just don't say we're here.
- Okay.

412
00:16:40,572 --> 00:16:42,305
Mmm. Hello?

413
00:16:42,307 --> 00:16:44,741
Ah, Doctor, I didn't think
you were going to answer.

414
00:16:44,743 --> 00:16:47,244
I'm just calling to reschedule
my therapy appointment.

415
00:16:47,246 --> 00:16:48,743
I'm on a quick trip out of town.

416
00:16:48,746 --> 00:16:51,114
Oh! Oh. Out of town.

417
00:16:51,116 --> 00:16:53,183
Um, uh... where?

418
00:16:53,185 --> 00:16:55,252
Oh, nowhere special, it's just Vegas.

419
00:16:55,254 --> 00:16:56,686
Vegas? Again?

420
00:16:56,688 --> 00:16:58,388
What you doing in Vegas?

421
00:17:01,825 --> 00:17:03,325
Well...

422
00:17:03,328 --> 00:17:05,128
don't you look ravishing.

423
00:17:05,131 --> 00:17:07,430
- Lucifer?
- Uh, sorry, I've got to go, Doctor.

424
00:17:07,433 --> 00:17:08,999
- Speak soon.
- Bye.

425
00:17:09,001 --> 00:17:10,333
What did he say at the end there?

426
00:17:10,335 --> 00:17:12,736
Um, something about...

427
00:17:12,738 --> 00:17:14,706
radishes.

428
00:17:17,176 --> 00:17:19,261
Well, you are stunning, aren't you?

429
00:17:19,264 --> 00:17:21,211
I almost didn't
recognize you, no offense.

430
00:17:21,213 --> 00:17:23,146
Eh, it's hard to get your glitter on

431
00:17:23,148 --> 00:17:25,248
when you're stuck in a lab all day.

432
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:27,699
But, I mean, Vegas?

433
00:17:27,702 --> 00:17:29,533
Where else can I bust out the bling?

434
00:17:29,536 --> 00:17:31,153
There's no reason we can't look fabulous

435
00:17:31,156 --> 00:17:32,889
and catch a homicidal redhead.

436
00:17:33,524 --> 00:17:35,308
Exactly.

437
00:17:36,302 --> 00:17:37,855
He didn't say "radish."

438
00:17:37,858 --> 00:17:39,825
He said "ravishing," didn't he?

439
00:17:39,828 --> 00:17:42,910
He's in Vegas with someone ravishing

440
00:17:42,913 --> 00:17:44,234
on my birthday.

441
00:17:44,236 --> 00:17:45,435
You know what?

442
00:17:45,437 --> 00:17:48,016
Why-why do I even care?

443
00:17:48,019 --> 00:17:50,011
Why do I care? This is stupid.

444
00:17:50,021 --> 00:17:52,821
Okay, feelings, feelings are not stupid.

445
00:17:52,824 --> 00:17:54,883
Well, this one is, okay?

446
00:17:54,886 --> 00:17:57,013
This feeling is stupid.

447
00:17:57,015 --> 00:17:58,539
- Okay.
- Okay?

448
00:17:58,542 --> 00:18:00,150
Lucifer and I are friends,

449
00:18:00,152 --> 00:18:02,172
partners, that's all.

450
00:18:02,175 --> 00:18:05,222
I'm totally past anything romantic.

451
00:18:05,224 --> 00:18:07,023
Full-on rearview.

452
00:18:07,025 --> 00:18:08,992
- In. The. Past.
- Okay.

453
00:18:08,994 --> 00:18:11,127
It is completely reasonable

454
00:18:11,129 --> 00:18:13,797
for something like a trip to Vegas

455
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:17,067
to trigger old emotions.

456
00:18:17,069 --> 00:18:18,371
Emotions...

457
00:18:18,374 --> 00:18:21,371
that maybe you haven't
completely dealt with.

458
00:18:21,374 --> 00:18:23,107
There's no expiration date

459
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:25,474
on the process of healing.

460
00:18:25,477 --> 00:18:27,597
We should go.

461
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,699
You're welcome.

462
00:18:28,702 --> 00:18:30,769
Where... where are my pants?

463
00:18:30,772 --> 00:18:32,872
I was wearing pant...

464
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:34,508
Oh, this is fine...

465
00:18:36,475 --> 00:18:38,509
Are you okay?

466
00:18:41,182 --> 00:18:42,615
Oh...

467
00:18:42,618 --> 00:18:44,928
Oh...

468
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:46,941
Screw the sock drawer.

469
00:18:49,201 --> 00:18:51,768
Bada bing! Bada bing! Bada bing!

470
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:54,704
Oh, that is definitely her.

471
00:18:54,706 --> 00:18:56,449
Mrs. Ham Hands.

472
00:18:56,452 --> 00:18:59,242
It looks like she's
the casino's pit boss.

473
00:18:59,244 --> 00:19:01,278
Right, let's go and chat up our killer.

474
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,480
Uh, could be a problem.

475
00:19:03,482 --> 00:19:05,949
Pit bosses are notoriously
hard to flush out.

476
00:19:05,951 --> 00:19:08,752
Only clients they pay
attention to are the whales,

477
00:19:08,754 --> 00:19:12,389
the serious high rollers.

478
00:19:12,391 --> 00:19:13,757
So, how about blackjack?

479
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:15,144
More of a poker man, myself.

480
00:19:15,147 --> 00:19:16,112
Poker?

481
00:19:16,115 --> 00:19:17,527
No, poker involves bluffing,

482
00:19:17,529 --> 00:19:18,828
also known as lying.

483
00:19:18,831 --> 00:19:20,063
Something you claim

484
00:19:20,074 --> 00:19:21,089
you don't do.

485
00:19:21,092 --> 00:19:23,706
Bluffing and lying, two
totally different things.

486
00:19:23,709 --> 00:19:25,510
So I guess what you're doing
with Chloe, and the whole

487
00:19:25,512 --> 00:19:29,739
not telling her you're in
Vegas thing, also not lying?

488
00:19:29,741 --> 00:19:32,417
No, that's selective omission.
Get it straight, Lopez.

489
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:34,831
Potato, potahto, po-too-toe.

490
00:19:35,847 --> 00:19:38,381
You, my friend, are compartmentalizing.

491
00:19:38,383 --> 00:19:40,050
Don't even know what that means.

492
00:19:40,052 --> 00:19:41,730
Anyways...

493
00:19:41,733 --> 00:19:42,753
Ooh.

494
00:19:42,756 --> 00:19:44,988
Okay, looks like Roxie's
working the blackjack floor.

495
00:19:44,991 --> 00:19:47,624
- Mm.
- So let's, uh, get you at the table.

496
00:19:47,626 --> 00:19:49,492
What, me? What about you?

497
00:19:49,494 --> 00:19:52,662
Best I just watch.

498
00:19:55,367 --> 00:19:56,399
Again?

499
00:19:56,401 --> 00:19:58,835
Beginner's luck.

500
00:19:58,837 --> 00:20:00,070
Right.

501
00:20:00,072 --> 00:20:02,372
Let's see if this
gets Roxie's attention.

502
00:20:02,374 --> 00:20:03,542
Oh.

503
00:20:03,545 --> 00:20:05,441
Booyah. That's what I'm talking about.

504
00:20:05,444 --> 00:20:08,478
Well, it's so much fun to
bet lots and lots of money.

505
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,780
And there's plenty more
where this came from.

506
00:20:10,782 --> 00:20:12,849
Ooh, nice. You have an 11.

507
00:20:12,851 --> 00:20:14,451
Double down, baby, double down.

508
00:20:14,453 --> 00:20:16,553
Right-o, doubling down, doubling down.

509
00:20:16,555 --> 00:20:17,687
♪ Mo' money ♪

510
00:20:17,689 --> 00:20:19,789
♪ Mo' money, mo' money. ♪

511
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:26,010
Yes!

512
00:20:26,013 --> 00:20:27,397
- Very good, Ms. Lopez.
- See?

513
00:20:27,399 --> 00:20:29,165
You're very good at this, aren't you?

514
00:20:29,167 --> 00:20:30,233
Teamwork is dream work.

515
00:20:30,235 --> 00:20:32,068
Look at all the money, eh?

516
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:33,837
Do you know, actually,
I fancy a drink, actu...

517
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:35,038
- Ooh.
- Here you are.

518
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,689
Wonderful service. Thank you.

519
00:20:36,692 --> 00:20:37,757
What's your name?

520
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,975
Mmm.

521
00:20:38,985 --> 00:20:41,319
Oh, that's perfect, thanks.

522
00:20:42,768 --> 00:20:44,180
What would you like, Ms. Lopez?

523
00:20:44,182 --> 00:20:45,815
I-I would like for you
to focus on the game,

524
00:20:45,817 --> 00:20:46,983
you just got two aces.

525
00:20:46,985 --> 00:20:48,464
What? Oh, right.

526
00:20:48,467 --> 00:20:50,045
- Well, maybe you would like...
- Split!

527
00:20:50,048 --> 00:20:51,647
Sorry.

528
00:20:52,758 --> 00:20:54,891
Ah, it's working, Ms. Lopez.

529
00:20:54,893 --> 00:20:56,626
Whatever you're doing, keep doing it.

530
00:20:56,628 --> 00:20:58,595
Yeah, order me one, too. Hmm?

531
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,667
Oh, well done, Ms. Lopez!

532
00:21:03,669 --> 00:21:05,104
Well done, indeed.

533
00:21:05,107 --> 00:21:06,702
Excuse me, sir.

534
00:21:06,705 --> 00:21:07,904
Come with us, please.

535
00:21:07,906 --> 00:21:08,839
Oh.

536
00:21:08,842 --> 00:21:10,542
Excellent. It's worked, it's worked.

537
00:21:10,545 --> 00:21:12,408
Right, off to the high
rollers' suite, are we?

538
00:21:14,846 --> 00:21:18,010
Yeah, I don't think that's
where they're taking us.

539
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:23,205
What sort of casino
back room is this anyway?

540
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:24,734
I mean, where's the dangling lightbulb

541
00:21:24,736 --> 00:21:26,169
and the bloodstained floor?

542
00:21:26,171 --> 00:21:27,303
Where's Joe Pesci?

543
00:21:27,305 --> 00:21:29,439
Hey, go easy.

544
00:21:29,441 --> 00:21:30,506
I'm going blind here.

545
00:21:30,508 --> 00:21:32,675
It seems maiming us isn't
even in their agenda.

546
00:21:32,677 --> 00:21:35,365
Quite frankly, I'm
disappointed, gentlemen.

547
00:21:35,368 --> 00:21:38,347
Well, actually, I'm slightly
less disappointed now.

548
00:21:39,384 --> 00:21:40,416
Oh.

549
00:21:40,418 --> 00:21:41,951
It's you.

550
00:21:41,953 --> 00:21:44,220
So maybe this wasn't
a total waste of time.

551
00:21:44,222 --> 00:21:46,289
Mm, maybe we should stop talking.

552
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:48,825
And by "we," I mean "you."

553
00:21:58,357 --> 00:22:01,304
So, I guess the disguise
didn't do it for you.

554
00:22:01,306 --> 00:22:04,373
Very few people can count
cards like you, Ms. Lopez.

555
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:07,076
Count cards? Oh, I'm impressed.

556
00:22:07,078 --> 00:22:09,421
So am I. Your technique's so infamous,

557
00:22:09,424 --> 00:22:11,691
we were able to spot
you in, what was it?

558
00:22:11,694 --> 00:22:12,791
Half an hour?

559
00:22:12,794 --> 00:22:15,818
43 minutes. You guys are getting lax.

560
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:17,453
Question is,

561
00:22:17,455 --> 00:22:19,122
what do I do with you?

562
00:22:19,124 --> 00:22:22,925
If banning you from
the casino didn't work,

563
00:22:22,927 --> 00:22:26,395
maybe I should call your new friends

564
00:22:26,397 --> 00:22:28,564
at the LAPD.

565
00:22:28,566 --> 00:22:29,832
Okay.

566
00:22:29,834 --> 00:22:31,521
Fine. Go right ahead.

567
00:22:31,524 --> 00:22:32,969
And, you know, while you're at it,

568
00:22:32,971 --> 00:22:35,338
why don't you tell
them about your crimes?

569
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:36,911
- What?
- Yes.

570
00:22:36,914 --> 00:22:38,874
J'accuse. First of all,

571
00:22:38,877 --> 00:22:41,277
of mixing Corinthian and Doric columns

572
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:42,454
in your McMansion.

573
00:22:42,457 --> 00:22:44,251
I mean... and secondly,

574
00:22:44,254 --> 00:22:47,507
of killing your husband and who
you thought was his mistress.

575
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:49,076
Louie's dead?

576
00:22:49,079 --> 00:22:51,220
Hello.

577
00:22:51,222 --> 00:22:52,555
Yes, Louie's dead,

578
00:22:52,557 --> 00:22:54,243
savagely murdered by you.

579
00:22:54,246 --> 00:22:55,445
Hmm.

580
00:22:55,448 --> 00:22:57,026
Wow.

581
00:22:57,028 --> 00:22:59,495
Her poker face is amazing, take note.

582
00:23:00,852 --> 00:23:02,216
My husband was a crook.

583
00:23:02,219 --> 00:23:03,633
I knew it was only a matter of time

584
00:23:03,635 --> 00:23:04,967
before his ticket got punched.

585
00:23:04,969 --> 00:23:07,333
But I certainly didn't
kill him or anyone else.

586
00:23:07,336 --> 00:23:08,504
Okay.

587
00:23:08,506 --> 00:23:10,706
Very well, Roxie, if you
didn't want Louie dead,

588
00:23:10,708 --> 00:23:12,141
then tell me, what do you want?

589
00:23:12,143 --> 00:23:14,710
I, uh...

590
00:23:14,712 --> 00:23:15,845
Yes?

591
00:23:15,847 --> 00:23:20,149
I want the pro golfer on table four.

592
00:23:20,151 --> 00:23:21,484
Bad.

593
00:23:22,789 --> 00:23:25,927
I've been trying to pick up his
sweet ass for two days straight.

594
00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:28,491
I worked a triple shift just
to keep him in my sights,

595
00:23:28,493 --> 00:23:30,760
and I think I'm really close
to getting a hole in one.

596
00:23:30,762 --> 00:23:31,961
You know what I mean?

597
00:23:31,963 --> 00:23:32,995
Oh, dear.

598
00:23:32,997 --> 00:23:34,931
Well, as the detective would say

599
00:23:34,933 --> 00:23:35,938
in this situation,

600
00:23:35,941 --> 00:23:38,477
- that means no motive.
- Or opportunity.

601
00:23:40,138 --> 00:23:42,672
Damn it, 6-6-6 didn't work, either.

602
00:23:42,674 --> 00:23:44,507
Try 8-0-0-8.

603
00:23:44,509 --> 00:23:46,036
8-0-0-8?

604
00:23:46,039 --> 00:23:47,476
It spells "boob."

605
00:23:47,478 --> 00:23:48,978
Ah.

606
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:50,413
No.

607
00:23:50,415 --> 00:23:52,148
You know, normally, I
wouldn't be so concerned

608
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:53,749
about trying to get into this thing

609
00:23:53,751 --> 00:23:56,029
if I didn't think there
were some real clues

610
00:23:56,032 --> 00:23:57,286
as to where Lucifer is,

611
00:23:57,288 --> 00:23:59,789
'cause wherever he is,
maybe he's in danger.

612
00:23:59,792 --> 00:24:01,958
Right. Maybe "ravishing,"

613
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,235
I mean "radish,"

614
00:24:03,238 --> 00:24:04,826
is code for "help."

615
00:24:04,829 --> 00:24:07,530
Yes. Maybe, maybe that's
why he skipped town.

616
00:24:07,532 --> 00:24:09,098
'Cause someone's after him.

617
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:11,618
It would be irresponsible
for us not to open this thing.

618
00:24:11,621 --> 00:24:14,469
Or maybe you two just
had too much to drink,

619
00:24:14,472 --> 00:24:16,205
you're a little too curious
to leave well enough alone,

620
00:24:16,207 --> 00:24:17,773
which is why you hauled my ass out here.

621
00:24:17,775 --> 00:24:19,279
That mean you're not gonna help us?

622
00:24:19,282 --> 00:24:20,877
I didn't say that.

623
00:24:23,948 --> 00:24:27,250
Really have quite the
grit, don't you? Hmm?

624
00:24:27,252 --> 00:24:29,852
You have a good time on your own?

625
00:24:29,854 --> 00:24:31,854
Okay. Ugh.

626
00:24:31,856 --> 00:24:34,690
You are just full of surprises,
aren't you, my little Rain Man?

627
00:24:34,692 --> 00:24:36,225
Well, what can I say?

628
00:24:36,227 --> 00:24:37,760
We all have coping mechanisms,

629
00:24:37,762 --> 00:24:39,896
mine just happens to
be counting cards...

630
00:24:39,899 --> 00:24:41,797
Or, was, anyway.

631
00:24:41,799 --> 00:24:43,279
Coping mechanisms, for what?

632
00:24:43,282 --> 00:24:44,367
Poverty?

633
00:24:44,369 --> 00:24:45,810
No.

634
00:24:45,813 --> 00:24:47,907
It helped quiet the voices.

635
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:49,743
What voices?

636
00:24:52,454 --> 00:24:55,154
Never mind, forget I... said that.

637
00:24:55,157 --> 00:24:57,297
The point is that...

638
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:59,382
everyone has stuff
that they want to avoid.

639
00:24:59,384 --> 00:25:01,984
You know, like, like the
way you are avoiding Chloe.

640
00:25:01,986 --> 00:25:04,153
Ugh, how many times
do I have to tell you?

641
00:25:04,155 --> 00:25:06,687
I am not avoiding or
lying to the detective.

642
00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:09,747
I'm... protecting her.

643
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:12,929
Ah, you're protecting her,
or you're protecting yourself?

644
00:25:12,931 --> 00:25:14,196
Look, why are we even discussing this?

645
00:25:14,198 --> 00:25:15,932
Right now, Candy's the
one who needs protecting,

646
00:25:15,934 --> 00:25:17,199
and we've just hit a dead end.

647
00:25:17,201 --> 00:25:18,567
Right. Okay, but hold on.

648
00:25:18,569 --> 00:25:21,370
I mean, if we are gonna find a new lead,

649
00:25:21,372 --> 00:25:23,906
how about we start with how
you two ended up married.

650
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,253
Hello, Candy.

651
00:25:38,655 --> 00:25:40,021
My thieving vixen.

652
00:25:40,024 --> 00:25:41,924
I don't know what you're talking about.

653
00:25:41,926 --> 00:25:43,326
How'd you get in here?

654
00:25:43,328 --> 00:25:45,528
Impressive grift you've got going.

655
00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:49,832
But, uh, I'm afraid that you
can't keep this little beauty.

656
00:25:49,834 --> 00:25:52,368
No, please, please, please,
I'm sorry, I'm sor...

657
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:54,670
Sentimental value.

658
00:25:54,672 --> 00:25:57,596
But, uh, you're welcome
to keep the cash.

659
00:25:57,599 --> 00:25:59,599
Goodness knows where you've hidden that.

660
00:26:03,314 --> 00:26:05,646
I'm so sorry, please
don't call the cops.

661
00:26:05,649 --> 00:26:07,450
It's just...

662
00:26:07,452 --> 00:26:09,185
my dad died recently and...

663
00:26:09,187 --> 00:26:11,287
he used to own the
club I was singing at.

664
00:26:11,289 --> 00:26:12,788
- You know, Fletcher's?
- Mm.

665
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:15,358
But he owed this
ginormous amount of cash

666
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,726
to this super scary loan shark,

667
00:26:16,728 --> 00:26:19,829
Louie Pagliani, and he
used the club as collateral,

668
00:26:19,831 --> 00:26:22,701
and if I don't come up
with 300 grand, like now,

669
00:26:22,704 --> 00:26:24,467
Louie's gonna take it.

670
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:26,727
And who knows what else.

671
00:26:27,988 --> 00:26:30,421
I didn't know what else to do!

672
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:36,006
Bravo, you really are quite
the performer, aren't you?

673
00:26:36,009 --> 00:26:38,547
You, you don't believe me?

674
00:26:38,549 --> 00:26:41,451
What, the weepy
waterworks? Not a chance.

675
00:26:41,454 --> 00:26:43,586
But your story seems legit, though.

676
00:26:48,326 --> 00:26:49,615
It is.

677
00:26:49,618 --> 00:26:51,794
And so is my apology.

678
00:26:52,930 --> 00:26:55,031
I actually felt bad.

679
00:26:55,033 --> 00:26:56,465
From the looks of you at the bar,

680
00:26:56,467 --> 00:26:58,701
you got your own problems to deal with.

681
00:26:58,703 --> 00:27:00,002
Yeah.

682
00:27:00,004 --> 00:27:02,204
Nothing I can't handle on my own.

683
00:27:02,206 --> 00:27:03,472
You sure about that?

684
00:27:08,446 --> 00:27:12,148
And so, you see, I...

685
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:13,582
I had to leave.

686
00:27:13,584 --> 00:27:16,419
Hmm, I get it.

687
00:27:16,421 --> 00:27:18,099
The part about your dad

688
00:27:18,102 --> 00:27:20,823
putting the detective in
your path is kind of fuzzy,

689
00:27:20,825 --> 00:27:24,860
but it seems like you
genuinely care about her.

690
00:27:24,862 --> 00:27:26,262
Yes.

691
00:27:26,264 --> 00:27:27,763
I do.

692
00:27:27,765 --> 00:27:29,345
A lot.

693
00:27:29,348 --> 00:27:32,601
Then, isn't you going AWOL
gonna kind of throw a big...

694
00:27:32,603 --> 00:27:34,154
flag on that play?

695
00:27:34,157 --> 00:27:36,505
No, I said that I care about her.

696
00:27:36,507 --> 00:27:38,374
Oh, unrequited love.

697
00:27:38,376 --> 00:27:40,209
Yeah, I get that, too.

698
00:27:40,212 --> 00:27:42,271
No, no, no, it's not unrequited.

699
00:27:42,274 --> 00:27:44,780
It's... well, the detective
has feelings for me,

700
00:27:44,782 --> 00:27:46,634
but she has no control
over those feelings.

701
00:27:46,637 --> 00:27:47,817
Okay, I don't get that.

702
00:27:47,819 --> 00:27:49,151
Well, look, it's difficult to explain.

703
00:27:49,153 --> 00:27:53,089
But I just...

704
00:27:53,091 --> 00:27:54,857
I just want to do right by her.

705
00:27:54,859 --> 00:27:56,992
I believe you. Yeah.

706
00:27:56,994 --> 00:27:59,361
Swap.

707
00:27:59,363 --> 00:28:02,531
Do you ever ask yourself,

708
00:28:02,533 --> 00:28:05,101
"How the hell did I end up here?"

709
00:28:05,103 --> 00:28:07,002
What, eating mint
chocolate chip ice cream,

710
00:28:07,004 --> 00:28:08,370
wrapped in a pink Snuggie?

711
00:28:09,574 --> 00:28:11,707
Pink's a good color for you, actually.

712
00:28:11,709 --> 00:28:13,742
Ah! You are a good liar, aren't you?

713
00:28:13,744 --> 00:28:14,777
I don't lie.

714
00:28:14,779 --> 00:28:16,278
Forgive me,

715
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,680
but you are a con woman.

716
00:28:17,682 --> 00:28:19,579
I am not a con woman.

717
00:28:19,582 --> 00:28:20,881
I am a singer,

718
00:28:20,884 --> 00:28:24,487
forced to do some things
that I'm not proud of,

719
00:28:24,489 --> 00:28:27,189
but only so I can dig my
dad's club out of debt.

720
00:28:27,191 --> 00:28:30,126
I grew up on that stage. It's my home.

721
00:28:30,128 --> 00:28:32,862
Drastic measures for
the things we care about.

722
00:28:32,864 --> 00:28:34,096
That, I get.

723
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:38,154
I might pretend to be someone

724
00:28:38,157 --> 00:28:40,560
a little less threatening sometimes,

725
00:28:40,563 --> 00:28:42,338
but I don't lie.

726
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:44,773
I call it bluffing.

727
00:28:44,775 --> 00:28:46,108
Totally different things.

728
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:49,245
Oh, well, that I definitely get.

729
00:28:49,247 --> 00:28:51,213
We're quite similar,
you and I, aren't we?

730
00:28:51,215 --> 00:28:53,315
Yeah, we are.

731
00:28:53,317 --> 00:28:57,386
Mm. Except for the fact
that you have ginormous feet.

732
00:28:57,388 --> 00:28:58,388
Oh!

733
00:29:03,828 --> 00:29:05,494
You know...

734
00:29:05,496 --> 00:29:09,932
there might be a way for you and
I to dig each other out, Candy.

735
00:29:13,069 --> 00:29:16,376
I'll pay off your debt
if you don't mind doing

736
00:29:16,379 --> 00:29:18,507
a little "bluffing" for me.

737
00:29:27,618 --> 00:29:29,051
Marry me.

738
00:29:29,053 --> 00:29:31,453
Uh...

739
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:33,842
And so, we got married.

740
00:29:33,845 --> 00:29:35,024
The end.

741
00:29:35,026 --> 00:29:38,654
Hmm. Okay, so, you fake-married Candy

742
00:29:38,657 --> 00:29:40,329
to avoid Chloe,

743
00:29:40,331 --> 00:29:42,698
even though you cared about her.

744
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:45,134
Who's the enigma now?

745
00:29:46,637 --> 00:29:48,370
- Don't even...
- Excuse me.

746
00:29:48,372 --> 00:29:50,005
Sorry, did I forget to tip?

747
00:29:50,007 --> 00:29:51,140
How rude of me.

748
00:29:51,142 --> 00:29:53,209
Lucifer.

749
00:29:53,211 --> 00:29:54,690
Candy?

750
00:29:54,693 --> 00:29:57,427
What are you doing here?
You're gonna ruin everything.

751
00:29:57,430 --> 00:29:59,782
I...

752
00:29:59,784 --> 00:30:01,259
Uh...

753
00:30:03,194 --> 00:30:05,679
As much as I love the
Bettie Page vibe, you've got

754
00:30:05,682 --> 00:30:07,953
a bull's-eye on your back, this
is hardly a good hiding place.

755
00:30:07,955 --> 00:30:09,988
- But it is where my killer works.
- What...?

756
00:30:09,991 --> 00:30:11,372
You're onto Roxie as well?

757
00:30:11,374 --> 00:30:14,108
Until you and your
sidekick derailed things.

758
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:16,076
Not my sidekick, and
I hate to disappoint,

759
00:30:16,078 --> 00:30:18,412
but Roxie Pagliani did
not kill your look-alike.

760
00:30:18,414 --> 00:30:19,713
Ali.

761
00:30:19,715 --> 00:30:21,312
Her name was Ali.

762
00:30:21,315 --> 00:30:22,683
She broke up with her boyfriend,

763
00:30:22,685 --> 00:30:24,351
so I said she could stay with me.

764
00:30:24,353 --> 00:30:26,353
I was just trying to be a good friend.

765
00:30:26,355 --> 00:30:27,655
Oh, man.

766
00:30:27,657 --> 00:30:29,256
I'm so sorry.

767
00:30:31,952 --> 00:30:33,352
Anyway.

768
00:30:33,355 --> 00:30:36,597
Anyway, Roxie Pagliani did not kill Ali

769
00:30:36,599 --> 00:30:38,332
or her husband in a jealous fit of rage.

770
00:30:38,334 --> 00:30:40,601
I mean, the woman's about as
passionate as a protein bar.

771
00:30:40,603 --> 00:30:42,236
This has nothing to do with passion.

772
00:30:42,238 --> 00:30:44,805
The killer wants my father's club.

773
00:30:44,807 --> 00:30:46,940
Fletcher's? How do you know that?

774
00:30:46,942 --> 00:30:49,243
After I found Ali dead,

775
00:30:49,245 --> 00:30:52,320
I noticed there was only one
thing missing from my apartment.

776
00:30:52,323 --> 00:30:54,114
The pocket deed for Fletcher's.

777
00:30:54,116 --> 00:30:56,250
Whoever possesses the
deed owns the club.

778
00:30:56,252 --> 00:30:57,317
It was used as collateral

779
00:30:57,319 --> 00:30:58,918
when my dad borrowed money from Louie.

780
00:30:58,921 --> 00:31:01,055
But when I went to confront him,

781
00:31:01,057 --> 00:31:02,367
he was already dead.

782
00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:05,092
Oh, that's why her hair
was at the crime scene.

783
00:31:05,094 --> 00:31:07,528
So I thought, well, maybe
Louie told Roxie about the deed,

784
00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:08,929
and she's the one who got greedy.

785
00:31:08,931 --> 00:31:10,130
Sadly, no.

786
00:31:10,132 --> 00:31:11,932
Roxie was working at
the time of the murder.

787
00:31:11,934 --> 00:31:15,070
But who else could've
known about that deed?

788
00:31:15,073 --> 00:31:16,603
Well, not to worry.

789
00:31:16,605 --> 00:31:19,840
There's a much faster way
to flush out the killer.

790
00:31:19,842 --> 00:31:22,276
Candy's still my wife. Legally, anyway.

791
00:31:22,278 --> 00:31:24,023
Which would trump any sort of deed.

792
00:31:24,026 --> 00:31:25,579
Exactly, which means Fletcher's

793
00:31:25,581 --> 00:31:28,215
now goes to the grieving widower, me.

794
00:31:28,224 --> 00:31:29,811
Yeah, but that makes you

795
00:31:29,814 --> 00:31:30,946
the killer's next target.

796
00:31:30,949 --> 00:31:33,460
Oh, I certainly hope so.

797
00:31:33,463 --> 00:31:36,320
Right. Come on. Showtime.

798
00:31:36,325 --> 00:31:37,825

Well...

818
00:32:52,268 --> 00:32:54,434
Lucifer's certainly
made his presence known.

819
00:32:54,436 --> 00:32:56,421
So, any sign of the killer?

820
00:32:56,424 --> 00:32:59,951
Any weird or suspicious activity?

821
00:32:59,954 --> 00:33:01,842
Other than your high kick, no, sorry.

822
00:33:01,844 --> 00:33:06,079
You try dancing with a
22 strapped to your thigh.

Oh, thank you all so
much. I'm here all night.

841
00:34:09,712 --> 00:34:13,413
No, seriously, all night.

842
00:34:13,415 --> 00:34:15,716
And now we wait for
the real show to begin.

843
00:34:15,718 --> 00:34:17,317
Mm-hmm.

844
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:20,053
- Whoops.
- Whoops?

845
00:34:20,056 --> 00:34:21,554
As in it worked?

846
00:34:21,557 --> 00:34:22,956
Well, uh...

847
00:34:24,493 --> 00:34:26,393
- Oh. Oh, don't worry.
- Oh.

848
00:34:26,395 --> 00:34:29,196
I've had a lot of experience
with giant holes...

849
00:34:29,965 --> 00:34:31,687
- in walls.
- Hmm.

850
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:33,233
A little Spackle and you're good to go.

851
00:34:33,235 --> 00:34:34,635
Well, it's a good thing I come packing.

852
00:34:34,637 --> 00:34:35,669
Came packing Spackle?

853
00:34:35,671 --> 00:34:37,537
Of course.

854
00:34:37,539 --> 00:34:39,206
I'll be right back. Excuse me.

855
00:34:39,208 --> 00:34:41,141
This...

856
00:34:41,143 --> 00:34:42,574
look at this.

857
00:34:42,577 --> 00:34:44,344
This is nuts.

858
00:34:44,346 --> 00:34:46,780
Yeah, but super fun.

859
00:34:46,782 --> 00:34:50,617
This is...

860
00:34:50,619 --> 00:34:52,753
it's pointless cracking into this safe

861
00:34:52,755 --> 00:34:54,398
because no matter what we find,

862
00:34:54,401 --> 00:34:58,369
it's not gonna change the
fact that A: there are things

863
00:34:58,372 --> 00:35:01,128
about Lucifer that I
will never understand.

864
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:02,085
And B:

865
00:35:02,088 --> 00:35:06,433
Spackle's not gonna help
the Assyrian antique wall.

866
00:35:06,435 --> 00:35:09,903
I think you and I both know
that this isn't about Spackle.

867
00:35:09,905 --> 00:35:14,546
He left on my birthday.

868
00:35:14,549 --> 00:35:16,726
And I wasn't expecting a big party

869
00:35:16,729 --> 00:35:19,087
or anything huge, maybe a card.

870
00:35:19,089 --> 00:35:22,182
You know, Lucifer is
a nontraditional guy.

871
00:35:22,184 --> 00:35:23,910
And he celebrates

872
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:27,171
in... nontraditional ways.

873
00:35:27,174 --> 00:35:29,208
Right, like going to
Vegas with some radish.

874
00:35:29,211 --> 00:35:30,376
Lucifer cares for you.

875
00:35:30,379 --> 00:35:31,712
I'm sure he's gonna come back

876
00:35:31,715 --> 00:35:33,718
with some crazy explanation that...

877
00:35:33,721 --> 00:35:37,265
That I'll probably never
hear about and that's fine.

878
00:35:37,268 --> 00:35:39,602
It's fine.

879
00:35:39,605 --> 00:35:42,406
I just hate that I sound
jealous 'cause I'm not.

880
00:35:42,409 --> 00:35:44,296
I'm not jealous.

881
00:35:44,299 --> 00:35:46,139
I'm not, I just, um...

882
00:35:49,645 --> 00:35:51,611
He's just my friend, you know?

883
00:35:51,613 --> 00:35:53,656
I know.

884
00:35:53,659 --> 00:35:55,335
What did I tell you?

885
00:35:55,338 --> 00:35:56,874
I am the man.

886
00:36:00,022 --> 00:36:01,555
Cheers.

887
00:36:01,557 --> 00:36:03,924
To the weirdest birthday I've ever had.

888
00:36:03,926 --> 00:36:08,554
And thank you for the
party, such as it is.

889
00:36:30,772 --> 00:36:34,086
Oh, dearie me.

890
00:36:34,089 --> 00:36:35,564
Rough night, old boy?

891
00:36:35,566 --> 00:36:39,826
I'm sorry, but-but this place...

892
00:36:39,828 --> 00:36:41,261
is mine.

893
00:36:41,263 --> 00:36:44,890
Well, well, well, it seems our bad guy

894
00:36:44,893 --> 00:36:46,959
is the good bartender.

895
00:36:46,962 --> 00:36:48,710
You can forget the tip,

896
00:36:48,713 --> 00:36:50,079
by the way.

897
00:36:52,176 --> 00:36:55,766
First of all, excellent
bluff, Mr. Killer Bartender,

898
00:36:55,769 --> 00:36:57,410
but I do need to tell you...

899
00:36:58,599 --> 00:37:00,566
I do need to tell you...

900
00:37:03,397 --> 00:37:05,848
What I was trying to tell you

901
00:37:05,851 --> 00:37:07,499
before you so rudely interrupted me

902
00:37:07,501 --> 00:37:09,434
is that because I know you're the killer

903
00:37:09,437 --> 00:37:10,536
and you can't kill me,

904
00:37:10,539 --> 00:37:12,337
you may as well just
hand yourself in now.

905
00:37:12,339 --> 00:37:14,172
- But I just shot you.
- Yes, I know.

906
00:37:14,174 --> 00:37:15,741
It's perplexing, isn't it, Juddy?

907
00:37:15,744 --> 00:37:17,577
Judd?

908
00:37:19,553 --> 00:37:21,119
How could you?

909
00:37:21,122 --> 00:37:23,089
Candy?

910
00:37:23,092 --> 00:37:25,626
No, you-you can't be here. I...

911
00:37:25,629 --> 00:37:27,118
I killed you!

912
00:37:27,121 --> 00:37:29,646
What the hell is happening to me?

913
00:37:29,649 --> 00:37:31,249
Who are you talking to?

914
00:37:31,252 --> 00:37:32,658
You can't see her?

915
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:33,692
- Hmm?
- But...

916
00:37:33,694 --> 00:37:37,195
Oh, God. What the hell?

917
00:37:37,197 --> 00:37:39,891
Well, interesting turn of
phrase, actually, Juddy,

918
00:37:39,894 --> 00:37:41,360
because I am the Devil

919
00:37:41,363 --> 00:37:43,702
and I believe that you're being haunted.

920
00:37:43,704 --> 00:37:45,671
Perhaps if you repent your sins,

921
00:37:45,673 --> 00:37:46,905
all will be forgiven.

922
00:37:46,907 --> 00:37:48,507
The truth will set
you free and all that.

923
00:37:48,509 --> 00:37:50,165
You were like a son to my father,

924
00:37:50,168 --> 00:37:51,710
a brother to me.

925
00:37:51,712 --> 00:37:54,239
I was gambling again.
I was drowning in debt.

926
00:37:54,242 --> 00:37:56,009
Why didn't you just
tell me you needed money?

927
00:37:56,012 --> 00:37:57,849
Because you don't have any!

928
00:37:57,851 --> 00:37:59,496
This place is worth crap.

929
00:37:59,499 --> 00:38:01,430
It's the land that's worth millions.

930
00:38:01,433 --> 00:38:04,400
I tried to get your dad to sell
and I knew you wouldn't, either.

931
00:38:04,403 --> 00:38:07,095
So, you shot me in the back of the head.

932
00:38:07,098 --> 00:38:08,527
Yes.

933
00:38:08,529 --> 00:38:11,029
Yes, I did.

934
00:38:11,031 --> 00:38:12,464
Now go away!

935
00:38:12,466 --> 00:38:14,246
Oh! There we go, Juddy.

936
00:38:14,249 --> 00:38:15,233
Leave me alone!

937
00:38:15,235 --> 00:38:16,535
Fire away!

938
00:38:16,537 --> 00:38:18,970
That's it. You're like a kid
in a candy store, aren't you?

939
00:38:18,973 --> 00:38:20,472
That's it, Juddy, go on!

940
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:24,643
My leg!

941
00:38:27,063 --> 00:38:31,032
Excellent shot, Ms. Lopez.
Another hidden talent.

942
00:38:31,035 --> 00:38:32,651
Thanks.

943
00:38:38,382 --> 00:38:42,151
And don't worry, I'll give
you props for the arrest.

944
00:38:42,154 --> 00:38:43,954
I'm cool like that.

945
00:38:43,957 --> 00:38:45,664
Gee, thanks.

946
00:38:47,434 --> 00:38:49,134
Hi.

947
00:38:49,136 --> 00:38:53,606
I just wanted to say thank
you for saving my ass... again.

948
00:38:53,609 --> 00:38:55,454
It's what any good
husband would've done.

949
00:38:57,311 --> 00:38:59,511
Come on. Drinks on the house.

950
00:38:59,513 --> 00:39:01,513
Uh, much as I'd love to,

951
00:39:01,515 --> 00:39:03,148
once Lola over there finishes flirting,

952
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:05,250
we need to get back to L.A.

953
00:39:05,252 --> 00:39:07,948
Speaking of L.A.,

954
00:39:07,951 --> 00:39:09,984
whatever happened with the detective?

955
00:39:09,987 --> 00:39:11,353
Mess it up yet?

956
00:39:11,356 --> 00:39:14,915
Not yet, but I-I fear I may be about to.

957
00:39:14,918 --> 00:39:16,851
Then what the hell are
you still doing here?

958
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:18,181
Go home, you Devil.

959
00:39:18,184 --> 00:39:19,865
Right.

960
00:39:20,834 --> 00:39:22,868
You take care.

961
00:39:22,871 --> 00:39:24,058
Yeah.

962
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:27,478
Lopez! Get a wriggle on!

963
00:39:58,939 --> 00:40:03,542
Well, I'm sorry I missed it.

964
00:40:05,145 --> 00:40:07,646
Could use a drink myself.

965
00:40:21,762 --> 00:40:23,695
I'm not exactly sure

966
00:40:23,697 --> 00:40:26,865
what you're all doing here, but I...

967
00:40:26,867 --> 00:40:30,702
imagine it's something to do
with the fact that I wasn't.

968
00:40:34,827 --> 00:40:38,629
And the truth is...

969
00:40:38,632 --> 00:40:42,314
I... went to Las Vegas.

970
00:40:44,249 --> 00:40:46,485
And even though it was
for a very good reason,

971
00:40:46,487 --> 00:40:49,354
I didn't tell you because...

972
00:40:49,356 --> 00:40:51,289
last time I went on a Vegas jaunt,

973
00:40:51,291 --> 00:40:53,821
there were some very
unpleasant feelings involved

974
00:40:53,824 --> 00:40:57,684
for both of us.

975
00:40:57,687 --> 00:41:02,434
And, well, I didn't want to
dredge any of those up again.

976
00:41:02,436 --> 00:41:05,449
So, I... bluffed.

977
00:41:10,344 --> 00:41:13,411
But I've come to realize
that perhaps bluffing

978
00:41:13,413 --> 00:41:15,348
is the same as lying and that's,

979
00:41:15,351 --> 00:41:19,850
as you know, something
I never want to do.

980
00:41:19,853 --> 00:41:22,410
Especially to you.

981
00:41:30,684 --> 00:41:32,564
Hello.

982
00:41:34,134 --> 00:41:35,834
Someone's been busy.

983
00:41:43,618 --> 00:41:46,878
Oh, perfect timing.

984
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:50,282
You've woken up just in
time for your surprise.

985
00:41:52,185 --> 00:41:54,352
A surprise? What surprise?

986
00:41:54,354 --> 00:41:55,907
Well, forgive my tardiness,

987
00:41:55,910 --> 00:41:59,344
but I thought it prudent to
deliver your gift in private.

988
00:42:03,702 --> 00:42:05,302
Thank you.

989
00:42:15,409 --> 00:42:16,975
Oh.

990
00:42:19,626 --> 00:42:21,780
Just beautiful.

991
00:42:21,782 --> 00:42:23,481
Oh, it's...

992
00:42:25,352 --> 00:42:26,751
- What is it?
- What?

993
00:42:26,753 --> 00:42:28,532
It's the bullet

994
00:42:28,535 --> 00:42:29,935
from when you shot me.

995
00:42:29,938 --> 00:42:32,568
Remember in the warehouse,
early in our partnership?

996
00:42:32,571 --> 00:42:35,627
Oh. Yeah.

997
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:38,506
I remember.

998
00:42:38,509 --> 00:42:41,933
Well, I thought since I'll
never likely penetrate you,

999
00:42:41,935 --> 00:42:44,235
I'd commemorate the one
time you penetrated me.

1000
00:42:50,377 --> 00:42:54,412
So, uh, happy birthday, Detective.

1001
00:42:57,250 --> 00:42:58,483
Oh.

1002
00:43:04,414 --> 00:43:10,004
